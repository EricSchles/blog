Beginnings
==========

I've never maintained a public blog before, so this is going to be my first time writing in this manor.  There are some things I'll definitely get wrong or misunderstand.  But my intention is to be helpful.  Specifically to write and share knowledge about:

* Statistics
* Probability
* Machine Learning
* Abstract Mathematics
* Science
* Professional Development

And of course related topics.  

Mostly this blog is for me.  A place to organize my thoughts and feelings about my professional life.  A sort of living journal.  But I hope it will be helpful to you.  Ultimately, this is for me though, so if something is unclear, maybe don't start with this blog.  I intend on writing several books which will act as primers for understanding the content here.  But this place is more or less for people that already understand these topics already.

In any event, I hope you enjoy my writing.  I'll try to make it entertaining, at least some times.
